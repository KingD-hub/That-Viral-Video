# 🔧 ADMIN PANEL TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## 🚨 Current Issue: Admin Panel is Blank

Your admin panel is showing blank because **Netlify CMS is not loading properly**. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔍 Step 1: Test CMS Loading

**First, test if CMS loads at all:**

1. **Go to:** `https://thatviralvideo.netlify.app/admin/test.html`
2. **Check the debug information** - this will tell us exactly what's wrong
3. **Look for error messages** in the status section

## 🔧 Step 2: Check Netlify Settings

**The most common cause is missing Netlify configuration:**

### **A. Enable Netlify Identity:**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: `https://app.netlify.com/sites/thatviralvideo`
2. Click **"Site settings"** (top menu)
3. Click **"Identity"** (left sidebar)
4. Click **"Enable Identity"** button
5. Wait for it to activate

### **B. Enable Git Gateway:**
1. In the same Identity section
2. Click **"Services"** tab
3. Click **"Enable Git Gateway"** button
4. Wait for it to activate

### **C. Invite Yourself as User:**
1. In Identity section, click **"Invite users"** tab
2. Enter your email address
3. Click **"Invite user"**
4. Check your email and accept the invitation
5. Set a password for your account

## 🎯 Step 3: Check Repository Access

**Make sure Netlify can access your GitHub repository:**

1. Go to **"Site settings"** → **"Build & deploy"**
2. Check that **"Repository"** shows your GitHub repo
3. Verify **"Branch"** is set to `main`
4. Make sure **"Publish directory"** is set to `.` (dot)

## 📝 Step 4: Verify Configuration Files

**Check these files are in your repository:**

### **Required Files:**
- ✅ `admin/index.html` - Admin panel page
- ✅ `admin/config.yml` - CMS configuration
- ✅ `site-config.json` - Site settings

### **Check `admin/config.yml`:**
```yaml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main

local_backend: false

media_folder: "assets/uploads"
public_folder: "/assets/uploads"

collections:
  - name: "videos"
    label: "Videos"
    folder: "videos"
    create: true
    # ... rest of config
```

## 🚀 Step 5: Deploy and Test

**After fixing Netlify settings:**

1. **Upload updated files** to GitHub
2. **Wait for Netlify to deploy** (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. **Go to:** `https://thatviralvideo.netlify.app/admin/`
4. **Login** with your Netlify Identity credentials
5. **Test the CMS** - should now load properly

## 🔍 Step 6: Debug Information

**If still not working, check the test page:**

1. **Go to:** `https://thatviralvideo.netlify.app/admin/test.html`
2. **Look for these status messages:**
   - ✅ **"Netlify Identity script loaded"** - Identity is working
   - ✅ **"Netlify CMS loaded successfully"** - CMS is working
   - ❌ **Error messages** - Will tell us exactly what's wrong

## 🎯 Common Issues and Solutions:

### **Issue 1: "Unable to access identity settings"**
**Solution:** Enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway

### **Issue 2: "Git Gateway not configured"**
**Solution:** Enable Git Gateway in Identity settings

### **Issue 3: "Repository access denied"**
**Solution:** Check repository permissions in Netlify

### **Issue 4: "CMS loads but shows blank"**
**Solution:** Check `admin/config.yml` configuration

### **Issue 5: "Login not working"**
**Solution:** Make sure you're invited as a user in Identity
